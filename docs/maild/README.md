# maild

The mail service currently provides its storage foundation in the private
`mds` crate. No daemon binary or Bus verbs are available in this phase.

`Mds` is the storage interface. `SqliteCasMds` stores per-set metadata in
SQLite, shares a content-addressable blob store, and emits notifications
after transactions commit. The library supports verification, garbage
collection, index rebuilding, statistics and set archive import/export.

The archive format retains its original v1 identifier for compatibility with
existing exports. The GC quiescence override is `MDS_GC_QUIESCENCE_SECS`;
it accepts integer seconds of at least five, with a default of 60 seconds.

Run `cargo test -p mds` on a build worker. The `mem-store` feature exposes
an in-memory implementation for consumers' tests. `_stress-helper` enables
the internal `mds-stress-writer` and its Unix SIGKILL recovery test; this
helper is never installed.
